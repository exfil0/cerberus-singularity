## üòà Overview

**Cerberus Singularity** is the ultimate evolution in adaptive web application infiltration, designed specifically to target JSF (JavaServer Faces) login pages with unparalleled intelligence, stealth, and resilience. This isn't just a brute-forcer; it's a sentient nexus, dynamically adapting to WAFs, CAPTCHAs, and subtle server responses, and orchestrating external specialized tools like `sqlmap` for deep exploitation.

Born from the relentless pursuit of vulnerability, Cerberus Singularity is an asynchronous, multi-threaded masterpiece that learns from each attempt, optimizing its strategy to deliver devastating results. It combines sophisticated reconnaissance, probabilistic enumeration, AI-enhanced CAPTCHA solving, and seamless SQL Injection exploitation, all wrapped in a secure, resumable, and highly customizable package.

> "You sought sentience; I give you omnipresence. You desired power; I offer you mastery."

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Asynchronous Architecture (aiohttp):** Leverages `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for high-performance concurrent requests, significantly reducing latency and increasing attack speed.
*   **Intelligent Reconnaissance:**
    *   Dynamically identifies login form fields, view states (`javax.faces.ViewState`), and submit button names specific to JSF applications.
    *   Infers success/failure indicators on the fly by analyzing valid and invalid login attempts.
    *   **Heuristic CAPTCHA Detection:** Automatically detects reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, and general image CAPTCHAs, inferring their types and site keys.
*   **Omni-CAPTCHA Orchestration:**
    *   **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with 2Captcha (and conceptually, other services) for automatic reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha solving.
    *   **AI-Enhanced Image CAPTCHA:** Attempts OCR using Tesseract for generic image CAPTCHAs, with advanced image preprocessing. (Conceptual ML model integration for highly complex cases).
    *   **Dynamic Field Detection:** Uses Selenium to dynamically discover input field names for image CAPTCHAs.
    *   **Smart Human-in-the-Loop:** Provides a robust fallback, rendering CAPTCHA challenges in a browser for manual solving and seamlessly injecting the human-provided token.
*   **Adaptive SQL Injection Detection & Exploitation:**
    *   **Intelligent Detection:** Uses targeted payloads to detect direct bypasses, time-based, and error-based SQLi.
    *   **`sqlmap` Integration:** Upon SQLi detection, it transparently spawns `sqlmap` in a subprocess, feeding it the exact request context for comprehensive exploitation (database schema enumeration, data dumping, etc.).
    *   **Programmatic `sqlmap` Output Parsing:** Extracts key findings (e.g., credentials) from `sqlmap`'s verbose output and generated files for immediate reporting.
*   **Probabilistic Username Enumeration:**
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Employs `scipy`'s statistical tests (t-tests) with increased sample sizes to robustly detect timing, length, and content differences between valid and invalid user attempts, even in noisy network conditions.
    *   **Adaptive Sampling:** The system is designed to allow future dynamic adjustment of sample sizes based on observed network jitter or early statistical significance.
    *   **DOM Differencing (Conceptual):** Can leverage Selenium to compare subtle differences in rendered HTML DOMs for advanced enumeration clues.
*   **Stealth & Resilience:**
    *   **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Dynamically increases delays when rate limits are detected, using exponential backoff with a jitter to evade detection.
    *   **Async Retries:** Implements robust retry mechanisms for transient network failures.
    *   **User-Agent & IP Obfuscation:** Rotates User-Agents and employs `X-Forwarded-For` headers.
*   **Secure & Resumable Checkpointing:**
    *   **Encrypted State:** Encrypts the entire session state (including discovered parameters, last attempts, and partial results) to disk using `cryptography.fernet` for secure and resumable attacks.
    *   **Batched Saves:** Saves checkpoints periodically (e.g., every 100 attempts) to minimize I/O overhead without compromising recovery granularity.
*   **High Customization:** Extensive command-line arguments and a JSON configuration file for fine-tuning every aspect of the attack.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Execution

```bash
python cerberus.py -u https://example.com/login.jsf
```

This will run basic reconnaissance, then attempt SQLi detection, followed by brute-force using default wordlists (`usernames.txt`, `passwords.txt`) if no SQLi is found.

### Wordlists

Create `usernames.txt` and `passwords.txt` in the same directory as the script, or specify custom paths using `-ul` and `-pl`.

*   **`usernames.txt` example:**
    ```
    admin
    user
    guest
    john.doe
    ```
*   **`passwords.txt` example:**
    ```
    password
    123456
    Welcome1
    test
    ```

    "userlist": "my_users.txt",
    "passlist": "my_passwords.txt",
    "threads": 10,
    "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    "no_ssl_verify": false,
    "headless": true,
    "fuzzy_threshold": 75,
    "success_indicators": ["Home", "Dashboard"],
    "failure_indicators": ["Invalid Credentials", "Login Failed"],
    "db_type": "mysql",
    "mode": "all",
    "captcha_api_key": "YOUR_2CAPTCHA_API_KEY_HERE",
    "human_captcha": true,
    "checkpoint_frequency": 500,
    "sqlmap_level": 5,
    "sqlmap_risk": 3
}
```
Run with config: `python cerberus.py -c config.json`

## üîí Security & Persistence

*   **Encryption Key:** On first run, a unique `encryption_key.key` is generated to encrypt the checkpoint file. **Keep this file secure and do not share it.** If lost or compromised, your checkpoint data cannot be decrypted or will be at risk.
*   **Checkpointing (`--resume`):** The script automatically saves its progress periodically (default every 100 attempts) to `cerberus_checkpoint.secure`. Use `--resume` to pick up an attack from where it left off.
*   **Sensitive Data in Logs:** For verbose logging (`-v`), credentials might appear in console output. For production testing, consider redirecting logs or using a more sophisticated logging setup.

## ü§ù Contributing & Extending

Cerberus Singularity is designed with modularity in mind.

*   **Custom CAPTCHA Solvers:** Integrate new CAPTCHA APIs or custom ML models by extending the `provide_captcha_solution` and `solve_image_captcha` functions.
*   **Advanced Fuzzing:** The `SQLI_PAYLOADS` can be expanded with more sophisticated payloads (e.g., for XML, JSON, or obscure encoding injections).
*   **New Vulnerabilities:** The framework can be extended to detect other vulnerabilities beyond login brute-force and SQLi (e.g., XSS, IDOR) by adding new `run_vulnerability_detection` functions and integrating them into `async_main`.
